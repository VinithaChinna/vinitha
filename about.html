<b><span style="color:red">ABOUT OTP:</span><b>
<p>OTP is a simple to use, reloadable tag which enables automatic deduction of toll charges and lets you pass through the toll plaza without<BR>
 stopping for the cash transaction.<p>
 <p>OTP is a perfect solution for a hassle free trip on national highways. OTP is presently operational at 30 toll plazas across
 state highways.<br>
 More toll plazas will be brought under the OTP program in the future.<br>
 <br>
 OTP is an electronic toll collection system in India, operated by the state Highway Authority of India (SHAI).<br>
 <br>
 It employs Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for making toll payments directly from the prepaid or<br>
 savings account linked to it.
<br>
 It is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle and enables to drive through <br>
 toll plazas without stopping for transactions.<br>
 The OTP can be purchased from official OTP <br>
 issuers or participating Banks and if it is linked to a prepaid account,<br>
 then recharging or top-up can be as per requirement.As per SHAI, OTP has unlimited validity.<br>
 <br>
 7.5% cashback offers were also provided to promote the use of OTP. <br>
 Dedicated Lanes at some Toll plazas have been built for OTP.<br>

In January 2019, state-run oil marketing companies IOC, BPCL and HPCL have signed MoUs enabling the use of<br>
 OTP to make purchases at petrol pumps.</P>
